# Complete Case Analysis (CCA) on Missing Data

This project demonstrates **Complete Case Analysis (CCA)** — a common technique used to handle missing data — using a dataset in a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis is performed using Python libraries such as pandas and seaborn.

## 📌 What is Complete Case Analysis?

Complete Case Analysis (also known as **listwise deletion**) is a method in data cleaning where rows with any missing values are removed from the dataset. It is a simple and commonly used technique when the proportion of missing data is small and assumed to be missing completely at random (MCAR).
